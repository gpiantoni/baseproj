Template script to start a complete analysis on EEG/MEG data, using Fieldtrip.

The analysis can run on:
1) event-based data (using the eventbased repo)
2) MRI data to create personal leadfields (using the mri2lead repo)
3) sleep to detect spindles and slow waves (using the detectsleep repo)

To start a new complete analysis, called "ANALYSISNAME", you should go into the script folder (/data1/projects/PROJNAME/scripts/):
  git clone git://github.com/gpiantoni/baseproj.git
Then rename baseproj into ANALYSISNAME. In the folder ANALYSISNAME, you'll find a file called "projname.m", rename it to your ANALYSISNAME.m

Depending on what you want to do, you need to get the other tools for the potential analysis.

1) If you want to do event-based analysis, go into your ANALYSISNAME folder and type in command line:
  git clone git://github.com/gpiantoni/eventbased.git
The artifact-cleaning of the data depends on German's toolbox. You need to get reading access to: aar, eegcore, external, io, misc, mperl
If you have reading access, you should create a folder called "gtoolbox". Then in the folder, from the command line:
  hg clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/gomezher/aar
  hg clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/gomezher/eegcore
  hg clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/gomezher/io
  hg clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/gomezher/misc
  hg clone https://username:password@bitbucket.org/gomezher/mperl
Furthermore, two functions of eventbased requires custom-made functions: (a) seldata requires a trialfun_XXX to read the data in one big trial and create events (b) redef requires a event2trl_XXX to create smaller, event-based trials. 
These two functions and other functions you may want to add should go into a directory called ANALYSISNAME_private. I strongly recommend to use a version control (git) on that folder as well.

2) If you want to create subject-specific forward model based on the MRI, go into your ANALYSISNAME folder and type in command line:
  git clone git://github.com/gpiantoni/mri2lead.git

3) If you want to detect slow waves and spindles, go into your ANALYSISNAME folder and type in command line:
  git clone git://github.com/gpiantoni/detectsleep.git
Note that detectsleep depends on FASST toolbox for the sleep scoring.

Then you can start modifying the ANALYSISNAME.m for your analysis
